I am a Ph.D. student at [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en). 
I am a member of Computer Architecture and Systems Lab (SNU-CompArch) under the guidance of [Prof. Jaewoong Sim](https://jaewoong.org/). 
My primary research interest lies in accelerators for AI systems, and processing-in-memory.
I received my B.S degree from [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) (2023).
